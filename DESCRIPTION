Description: TimeAx, a method that models disease dynamics over time based on time-series data from multiple individuals, thus tracing the dynamics and progression rates associated with molecular mechanisms of the disease and patientsâ€™ clinical outcomes. Similar to computational sequence alignment approaches, which provide biologists the capability to understand DNA and protein function through a quantitative comparison, TimeAx performs multiple alignment of shared dynamics across a common trajectory, thus allowing the modeling of any type of continuous process and its quantitative comparison.
